Title: Bayesian Assurance Computation
Depends: R (>= 3.5.0)
Description: Functions that compute the Bayesian assurance under various 
    settings characterized by different assumptions and objectives, including 
    precision-based conditions, credible intervals, and goal functions. 
    All simulation-based functions included in this package rely on a two-stage 
    Bayesian method that assigns two distinct priors to evaluate the unconditional 
    probability of observing a positive outcome,  which addresses subtle imitations 
    that take place when using the standard single-prior approach.
