\arguments{
\item{n}{sample size (either vector or scalar).}

\item{d}{fixed precision level}

\item{mu_beta_a}{analysis stage mean}

\item{mu_beta_d}{design stage mean}

\item{n_a}{sample size at analysis stage. Also quantifies the amount of prior information we have for
parameter \eqn{\mu}.}

\item{n_d}{sample size at design stage. Also quantifies the amount of prior information we have
for where the data is being generated from.}

\item{sig_sq}{Known variance \eqn{\sigma^2}.}

\item{alpha}{significance level}

\item{mc_iter}{number of MC samples evaluated under the analysis objective}
}
\value{
approximate Bayesian assurance under precision-based conditions
}
\description{
Returns the Bayesian assurance of observing that the
absolute difference between the true underlying
population parameter and the sample estimate falls within a margin
of error no greater than a fixed precision level, \eqn{d}.
