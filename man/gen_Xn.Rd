\title{Design Matrix Generator}
\usage{
gen_Xn(n)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{vector of sample sizes. Length of \code{n} corresponds
to the number of groups being assessed in the study design
as well as the column dimension of the design matrix.}
}
\value{
Xn: a design matrix that can be used to assess the
Bayesian assurance through Monte Carlo sampling using
functions presented in this package.
}
\description{
Constructs design matrix using given sample size(s).
Used for assurance analysis in the Bayesian setting.
}
\examples{
## Example
In the following example, notice that passing in a vector
of length 4 returns a design matrix of column dimension 4, where
each column is comprised of ones vectors with lengths that correspond
to the inputted sample sizes.

n <- c(1,3,5,8)
gen_Xn(n = n)
}
